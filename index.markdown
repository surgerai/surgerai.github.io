    The Surgical AI research group at <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/">MSKCC</a> is a team of faculty, postdocs, and students who work together on developing novel computing strategies for precision oncology using machine learning for hepatopancreatobiliary cancers. Our group aims to perform cutting-edge research to provide better care for patients with hepatopancreatobiliary cancer, particularly for pancreatic and liver cancers. We focus on the identification of biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, and prognostication as well as prediction of survival and response to a therapy towards personalized treatment stratification for patients. Our research works are regularly published in top journals.
