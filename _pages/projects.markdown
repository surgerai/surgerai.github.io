## Ongoing projects

- Pancreatic leak/radiomics (Jarnagin/Josephine/Ankur)-(n=698: nw=480): \\
        Jaya started working on the prospective data; 2nd draft of manuscript ready
- Pancreatic leak/CT qualitative assessment (Jarnagin/Horvat/Josephine): (n=698) analysis done; Manuscript ongoing
- PDAC recurrence/pre-metastatic liver biopsies (Jarnagin/Lyden/Zambirinis/Bojmar): submitted revision in Nature Medicine
- Biliary tract cancer survival/genomics (Jarnagin/Yi): started working;
- Prediction of liver growth in the future liver remnant in patients undergoing preoperative PVE (Jarnagin/Thomas/Josephine/Pratik): Pratik making the final patient list
- CRLM response/radiomics (Intra-op Molecular Imaging grant; D’Angelica/Horvat/Ahmad): manuscript minor revision; Hadi segmented and Joao is checking; set up a meeting
- Bil tox/Radiomics (D’Angelica/Do/ Simpson/Narayan/Misha/Ankur): Ankur working on data collection; Hadi segmented data automatically, checking by Ankur
- Biliary tree/Texture (Saket/ D’Angelica/Horvat): contacted Saket, no reply
- PDAC Early Detection (Horvat/Alice): on hold
- PDAC/MSI stability (Alice/Ellis): Analysis done; Combined model AUC0 0.84;
- PDAC BRCA/PALB2 Mutation with Cisplatin, Gemcitabine ± Veliparib/radiomics (O’Reilly/Horvat/Do/Gandhi): waiting for external cohort 
- Fatty liver/Radiomics(Jarnagin/Kaloyan/ Changyu/Pratik)—LWP patients (n~40 prelim); prelim analysis showed signal; waiting for large cohort; Some data need to segment manually
- PDAC vascular involvement/radiomics (Alice/Horvat/Ahmad)-(n~200) segmentation ongoing Ahmad; Jaya started auto-segmentation of vessels and 3D shape-based feature development; 
- PDAC radiomics/inter-reader variability (Natally): Analysis done; Manuscript ongoing
- PDAC recurrence/multimodal data analysis (MSK Spore; Jarnagin/Horvat/Ahmad): extracting radiomic features; 
- Owkin IHC outcome/multimodal AI (Jarnagin/Naaz): abstract accepted in ASCO and ISMB; Remo segmenting CTs
- PDAC inter-reader agreement (Natally/Jon): Jon to circulate among co-authors after incorporating some points
- PDAC registration-based response (Wei/Horvat/Jon): extension of data; Radiomics of image after registration.
- PNET radiogenomics (Alice/Naaz/Pratik): Pratik to check the segmentation
- PDAC biology of CT-radiomics (Iacobuzio/Wei/Do/Shigeaki/Hadi)-Dataline request
- PDAC multimodal image analysis for outcome prediction (Dave/Schwartz/Do/Iacobuzio/Hadi)-MRI data collected; CT data requested
- Radiomics and IPMN progression to malignancy (Jarnagin/Remo): pilot study on 5 patients; requested for CT/ MRI
- Rectal Cancer Co-registration/radiomics (Horvat/Jon): manuscript submitted in Radiology; RSNA abstract accepted
