The [ANR project MALADES](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/decouvrir-luniversite/vision-strategie-et-grands-projets/malades-adaptable-and-sovereign-large-language-models-for-the-french-medical-domain) has been accepted for funding during the [AAP ANR TSIA 2023](https://anr.fr/fr/detail/call/appel-a-projets-thematiques-specifiques-en-intelligence-artificielle-tsia-2023/) on the track "Large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal data".

This ambitious project opens new perspectives in the biomedical field by exploring the integration and adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific clinical applications.

The project is led by the TALN team (LS2N - Nantes University) and involves the LIA (Avignon University), the LIS (Aix-Marseille University) and Nantes University Hospital (Clinique des Donn√©es).

Richard Dufour ensures the project coordination.
