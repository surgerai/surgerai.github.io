[A one-day workshop on "Language models for specialty domains"](https://gdr-tal-nantes.sciencesconf.org) is organized by the TALN team in the context of the [GDR TAL](https://gdr-tal.ls2n.fr/) (French national NLP group research interest).

The objective of this day is to bring together researchers and industrialists from the French-speaking NLP, IR and speech communities to exchange and take stock of the latest advances and issues around the questions of exploitation of LLM for treatment of specialty domains.

More information is available on the [workshop website](https://gdr-tal-nantes.sciencesconf.org).
