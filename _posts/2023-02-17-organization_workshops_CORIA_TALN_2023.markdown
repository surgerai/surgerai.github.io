Two workshops are organized by the TALN team at the French national conference TALN-CORIA 2023.

Both workshops are waiting for submissions: do not hesitate to consult the dedicated websites.

*DEFT 2023 (Text Mining Challenge)* https://deft2023.univ-avignon.fr/ 

Created in 2005 in the image of the TREC and MUC campaigns, the DÃ©fi Fouille de Texte is a French-speaking evaluation campaign which each year proposes to compare the methods of several research teams on a regularly renewed theme.

This new edition of the challenge will focus on the implementation of approaches to automatically answer multiple-choice questionnaires from annals of pharmacy exams. The corpus used, FrenchMedMCQA, is composed of closed questions in French taken from annals of pharmacy exams. Each question contains: an identifier, the question, five options and the set of correct answer(s).
